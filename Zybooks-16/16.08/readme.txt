16.8 LAB: Sum of products
Write a program that reads two lists of integers from input into two arrays and outputs the sum of multiplying the corresponding list items. The program first reads an integer representing the length of each list, followed by two lists of integers.

Ex: If the input is:

3
1 2 3
3 2 1
the program calculates (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 1) and outputs

Ex: If the input is:

4
2 3 4 5
1 1 1 1
the program calculates (2 * 1) + (3 * 1) + (4 * 1) + (5 * 1) and outputs
