16.6 LAB: Find mode
Write a program that reads a list of integers from input and identifies the mode (the value that appears most often). The input is a sequence of integers that ends with -1. All other integers in the list are between 1 and 20 (inclusive). Total number of integers in the list is unknown. Output the mode and end with a newline. Assume that the list is not empty and only one mode exists.

Hint: Use an array to count the number of occurrences of 1-20. See comment in starter code.

Ex: If the input is:

5 9 2 2 1 4 5 5 -1
the output is:

5
