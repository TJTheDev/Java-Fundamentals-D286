9.11 LAB: Grocery shopping list (linked list: inserting at the end of a list)
This section has been set as Optional by your instructor. The activity will not show in score reports or be synced to your LMS.
Given main() in the ShoppingList class, define an insertAtEnd() method in the ItemNode class that adds an element to the end of a linked list. DO NOT print the dummy head node.

Ex. if the input is:

4
Kale 
Lettuce 
Carrots 
Peanuts 
where 4 is the number of items to be inserted; Kale, Lettuce, Carrots, Peanuts are the names of the items to be added at the end of the list.

The output is:

Kale 
Lettuce 
Carrots 
Peanuts
