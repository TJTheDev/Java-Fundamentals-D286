9.9 LAB: Inventory (linked lists: insert at the front of a list)
This section has been set as Optional by your instructor. The activity will not show in score reports or be synced to your LMS.
Given main() in the Inventory class, define an insertAtFront() method in the InventoryNode class that inserts items at the front of a linked list (after the dummy head node).

Ex. If the input is:

4
plates 100
spoons 200
cups 150
forks 200
the output is:

200 forks
150 cups
200 spoons
100 plates
