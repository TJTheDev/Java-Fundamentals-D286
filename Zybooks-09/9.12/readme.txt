This section has been set as Optional by your instructor. The activity will not show in score reports or be synced to your LMS.
Given the IntNode class, define the findMax() method in the CustomLinkedList class that returns the largest value in the list or returns -99 if the list is empty. Assume all values in the list are non-negative.

Ex: If the list contains:

head -> 14 -> 191 -> 186 -> 181
findMax(headObj) returns 191.

Ex: If the list contains:

head -> 
findMax(headObj) returns -99.
