15.8 LAB: Count multiples
Write a program that takes three integers as input: low, high, and x. The program then outputs the number of multiples of x between low and high inclusive.

Ex: If the input is:

1 10 2
the output is:

5
Hint: Use the % operator to determine if a number is a multiple of x. Use a for loop to test each number between low and high.
