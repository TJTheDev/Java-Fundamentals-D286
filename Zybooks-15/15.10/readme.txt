15.10 LAB: Hailstone sequence
Given a positive integer n, the following rules will always create a sequence that ends with 1, called the hailstone sequence:

If n is even, divide it by 2
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 (i.e. 3n +1)
Continue until n is 1
Write a program that reads an integer as input and prints the hailstone sequence starting with the integer entered. Format the output so that ten integers, each separated by a tab character (\t), are printed per line.

The output format can be achieved as follows:
System.out.print(n + "\t");

Ex: If the input is:

25
the output is:

25   76   38   19   58   29   88   44   22   11 
34   17   52   26   13   40   20   10   5    16 
8    4    2    1
